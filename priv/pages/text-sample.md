This is **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code` text.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct BitSpan<O, T>
where O: BitOrder, T: BitStore {
  ptr: NonNull<u8>,
  len: usize,
}

impl<O, T> BitSpan<O, T>
where O: BitOrder, T: BitStore {
  /// Constructor
  pub fn new(
    addr: *mut T,
    head: BitIdx<T::Mem>,
    bits: usize,
  ) -> Result<Self, Error> {
    todo!("Draw the rest of the owl")
  }
}
```

```text
This block is ordinary text and
should never be syntax highlit.

This is a really quite egregiously long line that probably looks ugly on mobile.
```

```sh
cat ./demo.txt
curl https://sh.rustup.rs | pv | sh -- -s
# this is a shell script
```

Here is a `long run of inline code` {:.other} just to see it in the AST.
