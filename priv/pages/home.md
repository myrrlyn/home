I’m Alexander Payne, a programmer and lifelong Boy Scout. I currently live in
Arlington, Virginia, where I work as a software development engineer at Amazon
Web Services and volunteer as an assistant scoutmaster with a local troop.

When I’m away from the keyboard, I am likely to be doing one or more of
trekking, driving across the continent, rewilding my lawn, woodworking, or
diving. Sometimes I take pictures of landscapes I think are pretty, and use
those for the site banners.

<!--
I also believe in trying to make more normal the use of cryptography in ordinary
communication between people. As such, in addition to only serving this site
over HTTPS, I also provide cryptographic signatures for every served resource.
If you have my PGP public key or my Keybase identity, you can use those to
verify any page against its signature file. There are buttons to retrieve the
signature on every page.

This provides little value in and of itself, but now you’re slightly more aware
of the idea of cryptographic signatures and their use in ordinary life, which is
worthwhile in my opinion.
