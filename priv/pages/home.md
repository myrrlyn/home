# Alexander `Payne`

## Introduction

I’m a programmer and Boy Scout currently living in Arlington, VA. When I’m not
at work or in the wilderness, I like to [write Rust][crates], SCUBA dive,
carpent, tell my cat how good he is, drive across the continent, and listen to
way, way too much girlpop.

I’m currently employed as a software development engineer at Amazon Web
Services, where I work on bringing Rust to embedded devices. I volunteer with a
local Scout troop, teaching aquatics and wilderness travel.

### Girlpop

I’m a bigger Taylor Swift fan than you.

## Contact Info

Feel free to reach me through any of the methods listed here. My phone number,
like that of most Americans, is relentlessly spammed so I don’t broadcast it
anymore. You are welcome, but by no means required, to use my public key. It’s
a good idea but an irritating practice.
