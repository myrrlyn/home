        Hi. You are seeing this page because it looks like you are arriving
        from the orange website, Hacker News.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on historical statistics, it is highly likely that you are a
        bad person and we do not get along. Therefore, I am exercising my
        First Amendment right as an American to freely refuse to associate
        with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe that you are not the kind of person to whom this
        restriction applies, then I encourage you to consider getting your
        news from a different website.
    </p>
