# Dance with Midshipman 2/C Klaus Payne

## Introductory Letter

![Klaus in uniform][formal]{:.img .portrait .float-right}

**Dear Reader,**

I am writing regarding an upcoming social opportunity. As you are no doubt
aware, Ring Dance is rapidly approaching for the USNA class of 2018. Ring Dance
brings with it an assortment of bacchanalia and revelry which is the envy of all
and serves as a siren song to college students across the mid-Atlantic region.
It would behoove both your organization and myself to enter into negotiation
regarding mutual attendance of the aforementioned Ring Dance.

At the conclusion of the Fall 2016 semester, the class of 2018 boasted 1,090
midshipmen. With 25% female composition, this implies approximately 818 male
midshipmen in the class of 2018. Using the traditional parameter of 2% of
midshipmen partaking in a committed relationship, this leaves an estimate of 795
eligible male midshipmen in the class of 2018. Each of these midshipmen presents
an opportunity to attend the 2018 ring dance on May 20<sup>th</sup>, 2017.
However, the fairly ubiquitous opportunity to attend Ring Dance is a completely
different offer from the incredibly unique opportunity to attend Ring Dance with
me. The opportunity to attend Ring Dance with me is a *sui generis* experience
because it is a distinctly more excellent happening, guaranteed to be a cut
above attending Ring Dance with any of the multitudinous alternative options
available.

I would like to invite your organization, all members of your organizations, and
recommended affiliates of your organization to contact me regarding this event.
This joyous event is a traditional source of gaity to midshipmen and I have no
doubt that this event can be employed to our mutual satisfaction.

Below this letter of introduction I have attached further details about myself
so that you may be assured of the quality of experience awaiting you.

**Sincerely,**
