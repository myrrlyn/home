  <p>
    This URL is valid! However, the article contents it selects are currently
    unable to be rendered. The article source is
    <.link href={@github}>here</.link> and you can file an issue directly, or
    contact me through any other medium. I <em>probably</em> already know itâ€™s
    broken, but I would rather be over-informed than under.
